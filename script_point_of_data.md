## [INTRODUCTION]
*(Sound of a keyboard clicking and a short computer “beep”)*  

**Guilherme:**  
“Hey there, sofa analysts and future data scientists!  
If Excel has ever crashed on you — congratulations, you’re officially on the path to data science!  
I’m Guilherme, and this is *Point of Data — trends beyond the charts*, the podcast that turns numbers into stories and curiosity into learning.”

## [CURIOSITY]
**Guilherme:**  
“Did you know that Python, the favorite language of data scientists, was named after the comedy group *Monty Python*?  
That’s right — nothing to do with the snake!  
The creator, Guido van Rossum, was a huge fan of the British humor show *Monty Python’s Flying Circus*.  
So, the next time you open a Jupyter Notebook, remember: the most popular language in data science was born out of a good joke.”

## [LESSON]
**Guilherme:**  
“Now, here’s a quick tip for beginners:  
Before diving into dozens of tools and libraries, understand the **basic data science workflow**.  
Think of it like a recipe: you need the right **ingredients** — the **data** —, you have to **clean** it (nobody likes lumpy flour, right?), then **analyze** it to find patterns, and finally **visualize** it to share your insights.  

It’s not about memorizing code — it’s about **telling stories with data**.  
Start small: pick a simple dataset, like movie ratings or sports stats, and try to find something interesting.  
The key is to practice your analytical eye!”
